# PerforceGource
Compiles Perforce Changes into a Gource Readable Log

This is just a quick Python script I wrote in between classes

##Usage
It's a **Console application**, so using the console, type:  
`PerforceGource.exe <//DEPOTPATH> [-o <Output Path>]`

Before using the above command, make sure Perforce is running and that you're logged in!
